#### Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹

The name's Niklas, I'm 19 years old, currently living in Stockholm, Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª

I'm a passionate and driven self-taught Software Engineer who currently works with creating professional web applications and design systems, frontend development pretty much. 
I'm also expanding my limits in the backend world, with the goal of soon becoming a full-stack developer. 

In my spare time I write code on my personal projects, there I work with modern programming languages and try new technologies. 

Other than coding, I also invest some of time into the stock market.
